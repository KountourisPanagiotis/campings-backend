A [Coding Factory](https://codingfactory.aueb.gr/) @ [AUEB](https://aueb.gr/) Java Final Project.

## Description
The repository houses a robust, scalable Java 8 based project, leveraging the Jakarta EE framework to implement a RESTful JAX-RS service. Specifically, it provides a comprehensive backend for managing campsite data, with a local MySQL server serving as the data persistence layer. The project adeptly illustrates how to establish connections, fetch, manipulate, and persist data using a RESTful API, all bundled in an efficient, production-grade package.

## Key Features
- A RESTful API constructed with JAX-RS, enabling CRUD operations on campsite data.
- Utilizes the Jakarta EE framework for building a scalable and robust backend.
- Local MySQL server integration for data persistence and manipulation.

## Getting Started
## Prerequisites
- JDK 11 or higher.
- Local MySQL Server.
- Suitable Java IDE (IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse recommended).
- Basic knowledge of Java, JAX-RS, Jakarta EE, and MySQL.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/KountourisPanagiotis/cf-campings-jax.git
```
2. Open the project in your chosen Java IDE.
3. Modify MySQL server details.
4. Adjust environmental variables.
5. Build the project and start the server.

## Usage
Once the server is operational, you can interact with the REST API endpoints through any HTTP client such as Postman or use the corresponding Angular framework [campings-frontend](https://github.com/KountourisPanagiotis/campings-frontend) that was build specifically for this backend.
